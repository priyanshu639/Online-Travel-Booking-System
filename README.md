# Travel-Booking-System

## Project Description
This airline management system is a Java-based application which facilitates the handling and management of data pertinent to an airline business. The major entities include Customers, Airports, Flights, Bookings, and Payments. Each entity comes with features to insert, delete, and find entities by their respective IDs. The application also validates data and handles foreign key constraints, ensuring the integrity of the database.
